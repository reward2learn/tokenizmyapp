### PT Taman Bintang Bali | Prepared for Graham Bristow & Co-Stakeholders
### Date: July 2026

---

## The Appointment Mandate

Graham Bristow formally commissioned this review to understand why Red Ruby is under pressure financially and operationally — revenues dropping, gross margins compressing, supplier debt increasing, money leaking, and guests choosing other venues. This is an **exit viability assessment**, not a growth strategy.

---

## Current State Summary

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Jun 2026 Revenue | IDR 1.975B | Declining from Jan peak (IDR 2.28B) |
| Gross Margin Range | 51–62% | **Sector benchmark: 65–72%** — critically below standard |
| Fixed Costs/mo | ~IDR 1,050M | Exceeds low-season revenue capacity |
| Entertainment / Revenue | 14.5% | Industry norm: 6–10%; this is a primary margin destroyer |
| Supplier Debt Trend | Increasing | Estimated IDR 1.2–1.5B outstanding (requires Ama's audit to confirm) |
| EBITDA May 2026 | +IDR 166M | Only month with meaningful surplus; peaks not covering troughs |

---

## Exit Viability — Assessment

**Revenue trajectory is negative**: Jan was the high point of the observed period. Peaks do not exceed prior-year levels. Low-season months are getting deeper, not shallower.

**Gross margin erosion confirms structural cost failure**: A 59% gross margin in nightclub operations means COS at 38.8%. Industry-standard COS for nightclubs is 28–35%. The difference — 3.8 to 10.8 percentage points above benchmark — represents IDR 70–190M per month in unnecessary spend.

**Entertainment cost at 14.5% revenue is unsustainable**: Entertainment should cap at 10%. Red Ruby spends ~IDR 325M/month on talent when market rates for equivalent service are ~IDR 195–304M. This creates a margin death spiral when combined with declining attendance.

**Estimated exit value pathways**:
- **Pathway 1 — License + PT entity intact**: IDR 8–15B (licenses have standalone scarcity value in Bali)
- **Pathway 2 — Related-party transfer to StarWORLD co.**: IDR 5–10B (constrained by arm's-length requirements)
- **Pathway 3 — Management buyout with earn-out**: IDR 3–8B (lower base; requires management funding)
- **Pathway 4 — Liquidation**: IDR 1–3B (only FF&E recovery after creditor settlements)

**Exit window: 60–90 days from July 2026.** Beyond that, deteriorating financial signals reduce buyer interest and negotiating position significantly.

## Critical Actions by Stakeholder

### Ama (Financial)
- Produce full supplier aging report (Week 1–2)
- Complete inter-company reconciliation: Red Ruby ↔ StarWORLD flow (Week 4)
- Model liquidity stress test: worst-case cash runway (Week 2)
- Build sell-side clean books snapshot (Week 8)

### Made (Compliance & Legal)
- Confirm PT share transferability and permit transfer rules (Week 1–2)
- Audit inter-company transaction compliance (Week 4)
- Survey supplier contract exit/novation terms (Week 2)
- Calculate employment law severance exposure (Week 4)

### Lukas (Operations & Promoters)
- Stop ghost promoter spending via POS audit (Week 2)
- Implement operational cost freeze targeting IDR 900M/month floor (Immediate)
- Catalog FF&E with market resale estimates (Week 3)
- Negotiate extended supplier terms for sell-side cooperation (Week 2)

### James (Music & DJs)
- Convert talent to residencies; cut entertainment to ≤IDR 180M/month (Week 2)
- Identify which acts drive attendance lift vs. waste (Week 2)
- Build in-house residency roster reducing dependency on expensive visiting talent (Week 4)

### Graham Bristow (Shareholder)
- Set floor price with Ama — calculate minimum acceptable offer (Week 4)
- Identify 3–5 likely buyers (other operators, regional entrants, affiliate) (Week 4)
- Decide: full exit vs. advisory role vs. minority hold post-transfer (Immediate)

---

> **Bottom Line**: Red Ruby's operational model cannot sustain itself under current ownership. Enterprise value exists in the PT entity, nightclub licenses (scarce in Bali), and physical assets. Graham has 60–90 days to prepare for sale before market signals of distress eliminate buyer interest.
